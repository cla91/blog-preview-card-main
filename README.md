## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Relative units (rem)

### What I learned

I aimed for a clear and meaningful HTML structure using tags like article, header, section, footer, and time. I also ensured the h2 was semantically correct while also functioning as a clickable link.

### Continued development

I want to further explore CSS methodologies like BEM for larger projects to improve class naming consistency. I also plan to delve deeper into advanced responsive techniques or accessibility features beyond basic hover/focus states.
